This was one of my first projects working with React. Like the rest of the world in early 2022, I was obsessed with doing my daily Wordle and keeping my streak alive. I was also in the process of learning React and wanted a project to apply those skills.

This is a POC used to practice React and is not a perfect replica. I have a couple ideas for improvements I'd like to make but I'm not actively working on this project.
